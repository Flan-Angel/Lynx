I HATE GENERATIVE AI A LOT, so I made this little repo. Let me explain :)

I was a huge fan of generative AI a while ago cause, I mean it was so cool cause it was like having that smart friend on speedial.
After a while I, about two months before the windows 10 EOL (I had Win10 pre-installed on my ThinkPad). I started hating how slow it felt and the fact that
I had to run an AntiVirus as a background process seemed like some BS. I started looking into linux (yeah yeah techically its GNU, and linux is one of it's many kernels
stop being a giant fucking nerd)
